# data-science-project
Working on my data science project to analyse the quality of healthcare in Finland and comparison to other countriesâ€™ healthcare systems.  
  
The findings in this project will, hopefully, show ways in which to optimise and improve the health services in Finland in key areas that need more investment or reorganising. A more efficient healthcare means the quality of life of the population will increase.
